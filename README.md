Kriti Trading Strategy: BANK NIFTY Prediction Using Options Data
This project presents a data-driven trading strategy for BANK NIFTY, leveraging six months of historical options data (July–December 2023). By analyzing trends in open interest (OI) for in-the-money (ITM) and out-of-the-money (OTM) call and put options, the model identifies market sentiment and generates buy/sell signals. The strategy applies weighted calculations over recent expiry dates and incorporates risk management through threshold filters and stop-loss mechanisms. Backtesting demonstrates a 14.6% return—outperforming the 7.05% benchmark—highlighting the model's potential in real-world trading scenarios.
